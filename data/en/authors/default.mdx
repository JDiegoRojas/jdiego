## Hola <Twemoji emoji="waving hand" />Soy Juan Diego Rojas

My academic and professional journey has been a path full of learning and discovery. In 2020, I began studying Agroindustrial Engineering at the National University of Trujillo - Valle Jequetepeque Campus. This was the first step in my journey towards understanding the world from a scientific and technological perspective.

In 2021, I decided to broaden my horizons and began studying Theology virtually at the Institute of International Pauline Theology - Costa Rica. Which allowed me to explore philosophy and spirituality, and have a deeper understanding of the human condition.

In 2024, my interest leaned towards Data Science. I started learning and using programs like R and Python. Data Science fascinates me because it combines technology with my desire to solve complex problems and make discoveries from large data sets.

My goal is to become a Data Analyst. I am looking forward to sharing my journey with all of you through this blog.

## Education

### Agroindustrial Engineering

I study Agroindustrial Engineering at the **National University of Trujillo - Jequetepeque Valley**. I started in **2020** and I am currently in the ninth semester. The courses that have interested me the most and in which I have delved into are:

- Mathematics
- Statistics
- Agribusiness
- Design and Formulation of Projects
- Food Conservation
- Agroindustrial Technology

These courses have been fundamental in my training and have sparked my interest in various aspects of Agroindustrial Engineering.

### Theology

I started my virtual theological studies with a Diploma in Pauline Theology at the [International Pauline Theological Institute](https://institutopaulinointernacional.com/) in Costa Rica in **2021** and completed it in **2023**. The courses that interested me the most were:

## Why I Started This Blog?

> Because knowledge is shared...

I started this blog as a way to document and share the things I have learned and found useful throughout my studies. Writing and taking notes is an excellent way for me to consolidate my understanding of new concepts and technologies, and I hope this information proves useful to all interested parties. I would greatly appreciate it if you could leave your comments, thoughts, suggestions, or recommendations.
