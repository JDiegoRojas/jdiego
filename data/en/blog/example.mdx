## Introduction

Agroindustry, as a discipline and economic activity, plays a crucial role at the intersection between agricultural production and industry, encompassing everything from raw material transformation to the commercialization of end products. In the context of agroindustrial engineering, a multidisciplinary approach is developed to optimize production processes, promote sustainability, and add value to the food chain and other related sectors.

### Mission

The Academic Professional School of Agroindustrial Engineering is an institution that creates and disseminates knowledge through effective teaching, relevant scientific research, and exercising social responsibility according to the needs of the environment.

### Vision

By 2024, the Academic Professional School of Agroindustrial Engineering will be an accredited institution recognized for the quality of its teaching-learning process in the training of competent and ethical professionals, capable of contributing to sustainable development; for the quality of its research and social responsibility, through strategic alliances with national and international organizations.

## Agroindustry

> It is the economic activity dedicated to the production, industrialization, and commercialization of agricultural, livestock, forestry, and other biological natural resources.

Agroindustry can be defined as an economic activity of a set of companies dedicated to production, storage, conservation, transformation, distribution, and commercialization. They use agricultural, livestock, hydrobiological, and forestry products as raw materials.

It covers both the food and non-food sectors.

### Agroindustry Analysis

The development of agroindustry begins with the production of different sectors such as agricultural, livestock, forestry, and hydrobiological, where the products from these sectors need to be harvested, transported, stored, logistics, processed, commercialized, distributed in different markets, and to the final consumer.

### Historical review of agroindustry

Man, since prehistory, has felt the need to preserve food and manufacture clothing.

- Meat was salted, preserved in ice. Leather was used to make clothing.
- Man felt the need to make instruments that would facilitate food processing.

In recent history:

- New products such as food and the emergence of new processed foods (biological, dietary/light, enriched, biotechnological).
- Synthesis of chemical compounds, (vegetal and animal therapy to improve production processes).
- Development of competitiveness strategies.
- Design of new technologies in the food industry related to food preservation.

### Importance of agroindustry

- Stimulates agricultural production and diversification.
- Supplies the domestic market with manufactured products.
- Creates employment opportunities.
- Generates foreign exchange (exports).
- Contributes to the country's economic growth (GDP). (The agroindustrial sector's GDP grew by 13.7% in the last five years).
- Contributes to rural development.
- Contributes to the search for new markets.
- Adds value to the production of different productive sectors.
- Contributes to the sustainable management of natural resources and economic growth in the regions.
- Improves the quality of packaged products.
- Reduces post-harvest losses.

### Definitions of key words

- **By-products:** These are secondary products obtained as a result of the transformation processes of the raw material in a production line aimed at generating a certain final product. For example, in the case of rice milling, by-products such as dust, husks, and bran are considered.
- **Production for Third Parties:** It refers to the service provided by the agroindustrial establishment for third parties. It occurs mainly in the case of rice mills.
- **Installed Capacity:** It is the maximum amount of goods or services that can be obtained from the machinery and equipment of a company, in a unit of time, under given technological conditions.
- **Machinery:** These are capital goods that intervene in the processes of transformation of raw materials in their different states such as hulling, milling, refrigeration, etc.
- **Equipment:** These are complementary parts that intervene in the transformation processes, such as scales for weighing, worktables, meters, etc.
- **Production Index:** It is the percentage that allows us to know the amount of raw material needed to obtain a unit of the final or intermediate product.
- **Stock:** It is the volume of raw material, input, or finished products accumulated in the warehouse at a given time.

## Conclusion

Agroindustry emerges as a key driver for economic, social, and environmental development in a world facing increasingly complex challenges in terms of food security, sustainability, and competitiveness. The training of professionals in agroindustrial engineering plays a fundamental role in the continuous improvement of production processes, technological innovation, and the promotion of responsible practices throughout the agri-food chain.
